Description: Mutual nearest neighbor matching of two point patterns on the torus:
    Two point patterns (e.g. a stationarized lattice,
    a Poisson point process, or data from csv files)
    are matched to each other via the stable mutual nearest
    neighbor matching. Typically this results in a thinnig of
    one of the two point patterns.
